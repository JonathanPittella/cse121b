/*if(boolean expression){

else if(boolean expression){

else{
    //code if no other match
}

Notice the boolean expressions have parenthesis around them, and the JavaScript scope operators 
are used to indicate what lines of code executes in each condition. Here is a code example that 
evaluates the number of sales of product a company has for one day. The first condition checks 
if the number of sales is less than or equal to 50. Since the first check has been done, the second 
actually tests if the number of sales is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 1000. The default, 
'else', is the number of sales being greater than 1000.


if (numSales <= 50) {
  console.log("Way to few sales");
} else if (numSales <= 1000) {
  console.log("Average number of sales");
} else {
  console.log("A good number of sales.");
}

    case "C":
      gpaPoints = 2;
    default:

  }

}

gpaPoints("A"); // returns 3!
